This project is based on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Active pages

Only two pages are live :

http://localhost:3000/design
http://localhost:3000/roadmap-tech

The home page redrects to the Design page.
